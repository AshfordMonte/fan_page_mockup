        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p> Rush was a Canadian rock band formed in 1968. Rush consisted of Geddy Lee (bass, vocals, 
            keyboard), Alex Lifeson (guitars), and Neil Peart (drums, percussion) who joined the classic lineup
            in 1974.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> Rush is known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing
             heavily on science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy. The band's musical style has 
             changed several times over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into 
             progressive rock, and including a period marked by heavy use of synthesizers.
        </p>
        <p> Some notable albums include 'Hemispheres', 'Rush', 'Fly by Night', '2112', and their most 
            successful album 'Moving Pictures' which includes their infamous song 'Tom Sawyer'.
